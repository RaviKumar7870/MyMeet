<h1>Hello!</h1>

<h2>Welcome to MyMeet WebApp</h2>

I have used Django stack for this Webapp. The Purpose of this webapp is to reduce the load of students by allowing them to keep their all class link in our WebApp. In this Webapp one can simply login with their credential and store the class link here.

Soon We are going to implement Email Feature. By this user will get email as remainder just before the class start
